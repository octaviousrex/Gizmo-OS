# MiniOS
MiniOS is my personal Operating System, being built with COSMOS. I will upload the project when I finish the FAT filesystem, because then I think it will be presentable. The Password is 1234, but the code can be changed for a different one. See "What it does now" for details.

***Note that i am kind of an amatuer with this stuff, so this may stay barebones until i get the ropes of it. I am, however, always developing it. I would always take some help :)***

# What it does right now?
So far, it has commands, for basic interaction, and it has a password (though i need to make it be able to set a password on its forst boot).

# What did i use?
I used Cosmos OS Userkit, which uses Visual Basic Studio and C# to create the kernel and OS.

# Can i clone this?
you can. but i suggest that you get someone else's for now, because mine is pretty barebone.

# Plans:
- FAT Filesystem

- Clock
