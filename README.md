# MiniOS
MiniOS is my personal Operating System, being built with COSMOS.

I will upload the project when I finish the FAT filesystem, because then I think it will be presentable. 
password is 1234

***Note that i am kind of an amatuer with this stuff, so this may stay barebones until i get the ropes of it. I am, however, always developing it***
